# COGS118A Final Project: What's the Music?

### The final report contains no code, but contains some links to the code. These links will direct to a notebook viewer so that you can view some codes in related cells.

### Do NOT grade anything in the nbviewer, we use the nbviewer to simplify the reading process, but the nbviewer has glitches that did not update the latest version of the complete notebook in time, even if the code is complete.

## Please grade the true notebook from the link provided above or in this Github repo

#### None of the results should represent any subjective facts, None of the explanations should be referenced into any practical applications.
