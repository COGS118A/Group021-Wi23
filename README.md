# COGS118A Final Project: Classifying Song Genre

**The final report contains no code, but contains some links to the code. These links will direct to a notebook viewer so that you can view some codes in related cells.**

**We use the nbviewer which enables hyperlinks to simplify the reading process, the same notebook from this repo.**

#### None of the results should represent any subjective facts, None of the explanations should be referenced into any practical applications.
