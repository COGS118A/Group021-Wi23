Proposal: [Proposal](https://github.com/COGS118A/Group021-Wi23/blob/main/ProposalGroup021-Wi23.ipynb)

Final Report: [Report](https://github.com/COGS118A/Group021-Wi23/blob/main/FinalProjectGroup021-Wi23.ipynb)

Final Complete Jupyter Notebook: [Complete Notebook](https://github.com/COGS118A/Group021-Wi23/blob/main/FinalProjectCompleteVersion.ipynb)

**Important Note: The report contains no code, but contains links to the code in Complete Version. These links will direct to a notebook viewer to display the same version of notebook.** The reason is that on Github, a cross-notebook hyperlink cannot direct to the correct cells, it will stop jumping after opening the correct notebook. Thus, we are using a 3rd-party viewer to display the complete notebook so everyone can be directed to the correct cells. Don't worry, the views just rerenders the notebook, so everything in the viewer is the same as Github.

**Important Note: Do NOT run the complete version, the grid search and neural network will take 40 minutes.**


Thank you~
