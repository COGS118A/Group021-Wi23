    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "The goal of our project is to classify musical genre basic on a variety of features describing the music.

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the history of music, there was no such complex system to define music genre in earlier times. It was more simple to categorize music according to its period of time<a name=\"wikinote1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#wiki1). After the 20th century, creative musicians brought different format of music to the stage so that people start to categorize the music into genres. The music genre becomes more complicated as the technology develops. Nowadays, when facing countless music work, we cannot categorize a genre from its time. Instead, we may need to determine the music category based on its features, attributes, and listening response. \n",
    "\n",
    "A music genre or subgenre may be defined by the musical techniques, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes<a name=\"wikinote2\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#wiki2). This article describes how many people subjectively view genre of music. This is useful for human-being, but difficult to classify large datasets of songs without listening to and understanding each song in depth. We can find that music genre itself is not easy to identified by individual factors from listening since people may have subjective thoughts. We tend to believe that there exists some more objective methods in machine learning to categorize music genre with computer algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, music genre is a dynamic concept. Due to the natural evolution of music, it may appear differently in differnt periods of time. Therefore, a listening response might be outdated if a genre is gradually disappearing or shifting to different formats<a name=\"newyorker\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#newyorker). In contradiction, data implementation will not be affected by such evolution since data is measure objectively during that time period and measures a fixed in-time genre rather than a dynamic genre shifted from earlier times. For instance, the general keys of Jazz music in 1900s are different with Jazz music in 2020, but the computer will filter out the era's influence on keys."

    "\n",
    "For our project we have chosen to focus on the evaluation metric of the f1 score which we will use to try to evaluate how well our project is predicting the music genre. Due to having to store our data in a measurable way through our data cleaning to be quantifiable we need to see if we are handling these new variables are correctly being measured in a way where important comparisons have the proper weights. Since we need the project to be measurable we need to see that these variables that we cleaned are being weighed correctly which is why we will use f1 to try to compare our prediction of our training set to the actual genre to try to measure how many true postives and true negatives we have in our predictions in order to see how accurate our predictions are.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also compare these scores to try to see if there is any overlap between predicting certain genres and see if our different models have more power in predicting these songs better than others depending on our score that we get. In general using these different factors that we have deemed quantifable we should check if we correctly measured the weight of these factors and see how truly we were able to identify the genre. The reason we do not use sensitivity or precision because we want to balance the amount of these two as we know that having one being too high can skew our predictions from their bias or variance so we instead focus on the f1 score as our measure of power."

    "Due to the fact that each song labeled with artist and the name of the song there is the problem of these being identifable and since this data is likely not important to our analysis we will not reflect specific songs in our analysis and try to avoid biases due to song selections in our fold selection to the best of our ability. We will have our data highlight only the important aspects of the analysis that will not have identifiable links back to the data. We will have the songs instead represented as meaningless id code labels that will have no relation to the song or artist themselves to avoid potential bias in our data analysis and will instead focus on the other factors about the songs to focus instead on predicting the genre based on those quantifiable aspects rather than inherit biases we may unintentionally have if we based it on song or artist names. Due to the nature of us scrapping data that we ourselves did not collect we will comb through the data to make sure that there are no ethical issues with the data collection and that there is no bias to what was collected and that there is no PIID values that may have been collected in the data as discussed earlier. We will make sure that all genres are properly represented in valid ways and that our data analysis relys on purely numerical data that is comparable rather than our own bias. Furthermore if any ethical dilemas come up during or after our research we plan on adjusting our data to handle or remove ethical concerns within our modeling and deployment of the analysis. We will have our data in comparable and categorical matter where we weigh our data properly but if these factors are found to not be properly utilized or have a bias that affects our ethics we will try to reflect this in either our final project."
